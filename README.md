# Zeroshot Turkish
Fine-tuning script based on Hugging Face course and examples from transformers. Definitely not a good/clean one though.

### Fine-tuning on NLI
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emrecncelik/zeroshot-turkish.git
cd zeroshot-turkish
chmod +x run_nli.sh
./run_nli.sh /home/emrecan/tez/zeroshot-turkish/venv/bin/activate
```
